PEEL Release Notes
==================

PEEL was created by Pierre Terdiman (author of Opcode, co-author of NovodeX, senior software engineer for PhysX).

* april 2015: v1.01 - the Bullet single-triangle-mesh issue

	- the Bullet plugin was crashing or behaving oddly in all scenes featuring the "single triangle" mesh.
	This has been fixed. The reason was that the triangle's data was not persistent (contrary to what happens
	for other meshes), and since Bullet does not copy the data, bad things happened. It looks like all the
	other engines copy the data, since they were working fine. Thanks to Erwin Coumans for figuring out the
	root of the problem.

	- Opcode2 plugins will not crash anymore in raycast scenes without meshes (they won't do anything though).

* april 2015: v1.0 - first public version

	- PINT_Bullet was my initial Bullet PEEL plugin, for version 2.79. It will be deprecated soon, since it
	seems old and irrelevant now.

	- the Bullet 2.81 plugin is the one which was used for my "evolution of PhysX" blog post. As I reported on
	the Bullet forums at the time, the optimizations settings shipped with the library seem sub-optimal. In the
	provided build, I modified the Visual Studio settings to produce a faster version (it is using the same
	settings as what we use for PhysX).

	- the Bullet 2.82 plugin uses Bullet's own optimization settings (as shipped). This is a great way to show
	what PEEL is about, since you can run both 2.81 and 2.82 versions in the tool, and easily see the performance
	difference between the two builds.

	- the various Havok PEEL plugins are provided as source code only. The Havok license is unclear to me but I think
	I am not supposed to redistribute either their libraries, or even a binary PEEL plugin like I can do with Bullet.
	It should be ok to release the source code for the Havok PEEL plugin though, since PAL did the same a long time
	before me. People interested in the results should be able to download the Havok libraries and recompile the
	plugins themselves.

	- ICE Physics is a very old physics engine that I wrote before joining NovodeX (so, maybe around 2002). It does
	not even support joints or convex objects. However I think it still kicks ass for basic rigid body simulation
	of simple objects. In fact, it may still have the best box stacks in the business. Super stable, super fast.
	PEEL it and see for yourself. Only the binary PEEL plugin is provided.

	- the PEEL plugin for Newton 3.9 was written by Julio Jerez. It is currently quite incomplete (sleeping is never
	deactivated, object deletion is not implemented, CCD is not implemented, overlaps and sweeps are not implemented,
	etc) but I am including it nonetheless, since Newton is quite competitive and worth keeping an eye on.

	- I adapted Julio's plugin for Newton 3.13. This was a straight port, a couple of functions changed but otherwise
	it is the same as 3.9. Unfortunately I don't know how to use both Newton plugins at the same time in PEEL, since
	they both use the same DLLs (e.g. 'newton.dll'). I would have to use delay-loading to replicate the same trick as
	for PhysX, but I didn't have time to try it yet. Meanwhile, recompile the desired Newton plugin each time you want
	to use it. That should copy the proper Newton DLLs to PEEL's build folder.

	- the PEEL plugin for NovodeX 2.1.1 is provided as source code just in case anybody is interested, but it is
	terribly obsolete at this point. I haven't compiled it myself in ages.

	- the Opcode 1.3 plugin is an interesting case. First, it shows that PEEL can also deal with collision libraries
	(as opposed to full blown physics engines). And second, it shows that the venerable, 10+ years old, non-SIMD
	library, is *still* quite competitive today. In some cases it remains faster than a number of other, more recent
	implementations.

	- the Opcode 2.0 plugins (only provided as binary for now) show what a revisited, modern version of Opcode can do.
	So far it pretty much beats everything else. Very proud of that one. There are a number of compile options for
	Opcode 2.0, and 2 different plugins are provided, using 2 different mesh formats. One of them is better for
	raycasts, the other one better for overlap queries & memory usage. PEEL is a great way to analyze and track the
	performance differences between the formats.

	- the various PhysX plugins were the reason I wrote PEEL in the first place: tracking the evolution of PhysX and
	making sure each new version was better than the last. See for yourself. The PhysX binary DLLs are included, courtesy
	of NVIDIA. Providing the binaries should be convenient for users: the delay loading mechanism requires that the
	DLL names are modified for each PhysX version, so that they can all be in the same folder and used in the same app.
	This is not obvious and slightly uncommon, so it is good if users do not have to do that themselves. In any case
	you should be able to create a new PhysX PEEL plugin for another version, if the included ones are not enough.
	
	- a plugin for PhysX 3.4 is included, even though this version has not been shipped yet. PhysX 3.4 will include an
	Opcode2-based mesh format, so you can see a preview of things to come here. Expect performance gains in raycasts,
	overlaps, and sweeps! On the other hand, at time of writing there is a known performance regression in convex
	sweeps, and a bug in the PCM contact generation. Both have been spotted thanks to PEEL!
	
	- PINT_Skeleton is an empty plugin project. Use this to create a PEEL plugin for your own physics engine.
	Improve your engine today! Take the PEEL test! (100% of people who did that so far discovered things they did not
	know about their engine, and improved its performance as a result).

	- please report bugs or improvements to existing plugins (in particular Bullet, Newton, Havok). I will hopefully
	integrate them in the next version of PEEL.
